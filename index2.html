<p><h2>ABOUT TRAVELLING</h2></p>
<p>After details of Wiki Phung’s personal life came out the family stopped talking about the case.
“In the Asian culture, we don't really have therapy, we don't talk openly. We try to hide everything because what people think of us is very important,” said Loanne Phung.
The case remains open, but Fagan said it’s not being actively investigated, and they have no plans currently to re-interview the boyfriend.
Earlier this year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an age progression image of Phung, estimating what she would look like if she were alive today.
Loanne Phung said she doesn’t want people to forget about her sister.  “She still have a family that loves her very much, that wants her home.”
Just talking about her, Loanne Phung said, makes it feel like Wiki Phung is alive again.
“I don't give up hope and I'll keep going. Even after my mother's gone and after I'm gone, my daughter will keep going,” said Loanne Phung.</p>

<p><h2>OUR VISION</h2></p>
<p>When planning a trip to Iceland, it's important to remember that the weather can be unpredictable and change quickly. Depending on what time of year you're visiting, you'll want to pack appropriate clothing and accessories. For instance, if you're visiting in the winter months, make sure to bring warm clothing and waterproof shoes. For the summer, bring some slightly lighter clothes and don't forget your sunglasses. Also remember to bring all your necessary toiletries, medications, and any personal items you may need.When planning a trip to Iceland, it's important to remember that the weather can be unpredictable and change quickly.
